1. Error handling if student is already under a section for that term and year_level (or hindi kasi may mga irregular student na merong more than 1 section?)

2. confirmation of assignment ng prof sa section - create selection if more than 1 prof is teaching for that section 

3. Student portal - the rog should be only generated once the grading sheet was past the deadline set 

4. No option to edit name under users table once the user registered (prof and student) 

5. No decline option for the admins in the document requests from students -- they need to pick schedule or just ignore the request completely
